# The BitPerfect module: what it changes, and where to change it

This is the map. When something in the audio path has to be adjusted on these units, the answer is
almost always a file in this module — and this file says which one, what is already in it, and what
was measured about it.

**Repository:** `D:\My_K706_Magisk_Modules\BitPerfect2\`
**Current release:** `QF_BitPerfect.module.v5.3-Universal.zip` · `versionCode 503` — 📻 installed and
running on the reference unit (BU32107, single BT): detection names the chip correctly, only its own
route file remains, `Audio path is healthy` in the log. **Not yet tested on BD hardware.**
**On the unit:** `/data/adb/modules/BitPerfect.module/`

### What v5.3 changes

| fix | why |
|---|---|
| detection reads `${HW_CODE:1:1}` (sound processor) and `${HW_CODE:3:1}` (path), cross-checked with `persist.sys.qf.arm.use.i2s` | the old `${HW_CODE:4:2} == "21"` read the control panel + power bitmask, was **true on every unit**, and handed BD37534 the 24-bit I2S profile |
| BD37534 never gets the I2S profile, whatever the other flags say | analogue inputs only |
| the opposite profile's route file is deleted on install | `cp -rf` never removes, so each unit used to keep a stray route the HAL could load |
| the watchdog checks the **stream**, not the policies | it printed SUCCESS over a dead path; now it looks for `state: SETUP` + `trigger_time 0` + a dead owner and restarts audioserver |
| `persist.sys.main_volume` is no longer touched | it is the user's start-up volume slider |
| the I2S width guard only runs where there is an I2S bus | it was forcing `WD_24BIT` every 3 s on analogue units |

⚠️ **Packaging trap.** The repository folder also holds notes, spare copies, old releases and — at
one point — a 13 MB video. A naive "zip the folder" produced a 21 MB package for people to flash.
Pack from an allow-list (`META-INF`, `system`, `common`, `profiles`, `module.prop`, `customize.sh`,
`service.sh`); a correct package is about **1.6 MB**, the same as v5.1 and v5.2.

## 1. Where to change what — the short table

| you want to change | file | node |
|---|---|---|
| **microphone sensitivity** | `system/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd/audio_pga.xml` | `Music/<device>/Record/VBC_ADC0_DG/volume0` |
| playback digital gain | same file | `Music/<device>/Playback/VBC_DAC0_DG/volume0` |
| sidetone / DRC / HPF **on calls** | `audio_params/sprd/dsp_vbc.xml` | `Audio/<device>/<NB1…VOIP1>/st_control_*` |
| DRC on **music playback** | same file | `Music/<device>/Playback/st_control_0` — ⚠️ **factory, untouched, leave alone** |
| second microphone / AEC reference | `audio_params/sprd/audio_process.xml` | `aux_mic_enable` |
| which usage lands on which stream | `system/vendor/etc/audio_policy_engine_product_strategies.xml` | `AttributesGroup` |
| how loud each volume group is | `system/vendor/etc/audio_policy_engine_stream_volumes.xml` | `volumeGroup` curves |
| which navigators the platform ducks for | `system/config/NaviApp.ini` | one line per package |
| PCM devices, I2S width, routes | `audio_pcm.xml`, `audio_route.xml`, `qf_double_bt_audio_route_*.xml` | per profile |

## 2. 🎤 The microphone — the only lever that actually works

📻 Measured 28.08.2026, on the unit, four sweeps and several probes.

**Three levers look plausible. Two of them are dead.**

| lever | verdict |
|---|---|
| ALSA `ADCL/ADCR Gain … Capture Volume` (the CarSettings sliders) | ⚠️ was at **7 of 7** on the reference unit, so it looked like a dead end — but that was that owner's own setting. 📻 A second unit reports `4` and `1`, i.e. people do have room in both directions |
| `tinymix "VBC ADC0 DG Set"` at runtime | ❌ **the HAL overwrites it** from the XML every time it opens a capture path |
| `AudioSource.UNPROCESSED` (the `UnprocessRecord` block, gain `0x18` = 8×) | ❌ the block exists, the HAL **never uses it** |
| **`audio_pga.xml` → `Record` → `VBC_ADC0_DG`** | ✅ **the only durable one** |

🔬 The reset is easy to reproduce and impossible to argue with:

```
before the sweep:  VBC ADC0 DG Set  5 5
during the sweep:  VBC ADC0 DG Set  3 3     ← the HAL put its own value back
```

So anything set with `tinymix` lives only until the next capture starts. That is also why raising
the gain appeared to do nothing to a sweep while clearly working on ambient noise — the ambient
probe reused an already-open path, the sweep opened a new one.

### The three entries that matter

```
Music / Headset       / Record / VBC_ADC0_DG / volume0
Music / Handsfree     / Record / VBC_ADC0_DG / volume0
Music / TypeC_Digital / Record / VBC_ADC0_DG / volume0
```

`Bluetooth/Record` and every `UnprocessRecord` sit at `0x18` and are **not** on this path.

### The scale is linear in the register value

📻 Measured on ambient, doubling the value:

| value | rms | peak |
|---|---|---|
| `3` | −28.9 dBFS | −15.5 dBFS |
| `6` | −22.2 dBFS | −8.6 dBFS |

+6.8 dB for ×2, against a theoretical +6.02 — linear, within the drift of ambient noise.

⚠️ **Headroom is the constraint, not the gain.** A cabin sweep at media volume 5 already peaks at
**−6.4 dBFS**. Every step of gain eats that margin, and a clipped sweep is a ruined measurement:

| value | gain | sweep peak at volume 5 |
|---|---|---|
| `0x03` factory | — | −6.4 dBFS |
| **`0x04` (shipped in v5.2)** | **+2.5 dB** | ≈ −3.9 dBFS |
| `0x05` | +4.4 dB | ≈ −2.0 dBFS — too close |

If more sensitivity is ever needed, the sweep amplitude has to come down with it.

### 🔴 The MMAP capture port the module declares is wired to nothing

🔬 *(11.09.2026)* The factory `primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml` has no MMAP ports at all —
neither the copy in `D:\Release\update(2)` nor the Unisoc ums512 reference in `D:\UIS_android`. The
module adds `mmap_no_irq_in` (48 kHz only, `AUDIO_INPUT_FLAG_MMAP_NOIRQ`) but never gives it a route
from a microphone: it appears only as an extra *source* of the `primary input` route — a mixPort
listed where devices belong — and there is no `<route sink="mmap_no_irq_in">`. It has been like this
since the module's first commit (`f64bb9b`).

📻 On the owner's unit, where the policy is byte-for-byte the module's (md5 `df20e85b…`),
`dumpsys media.audio_policy` shows `mmap_no_irq_in` with an empty device list, while
`aaudio.mmap_policy=2` — AAudio would take an MMAP input if one were reachable, and none is.

Why it matters: the microphone has one input stream per mixPort (`maxOpenCount 1`), the first client
sets its rate, and an assistant hotword opens it at 16 kHz from boot
([05-AUDIO-PATH.md](05-AUDIO-PATH.md) §2). A working MMAP input would be a second, independent
48 kHz stream beside it. ❓ Whether the HAL implements MMAP capture at all is not known — the route is
the precondition, not the proof.

## 3. What the module changes in the AGDSP parameters

All seven files differ from factory. The factory also ships `codec.xml`, which the module does
**not** carry — the factory copy stays in force.

| file | what changed | scale |
|---|---|---|
| `dsp_vbc.xml` | `st_drc_en_l/r` and `st_hpf_en_l/r` `0x01` → `0x00`; `st_en_l/r` off in 6 profiles | 63 profiles per channel |
| `audio_process.xml` | `aux_mic_enable` `0x01` → `0x00` | 120 lines |
| `audio_pga.xml` | input gains levelled to `0x20`; capture `Record` `0x03` → `0x04` in v5.2 | 10 + 3 |
| `audio_structure.xml` | **identical to 4.18**, `md5 e6df1a9e81` | — |
| `audio_effects.xml` | **identical to 4.18**, `md5 250123e35e` | — |

🔴 **The DRC that is switched off is the one on voice calls, not on music.** Walked the tree to be
sure: the 63 profiles live under `Audio/<device>/{NB1,NB2,WB1,WB2,SWB1,FB1,VOIP1}/st_control_*` and
under `Loopback`. On `Music/<device>/Playback/st_control_0` the value is `0x1` — **enabled, and
byte-identical to factory**. Nothing the module does removes the limiter from the music path.

This matters because it was suspected of causing bad mixing when music and a navigation prompt sum
together. It cannot: that path was never touched.

📻 Counted per AGDSP mode, ours against factory:

| mode | ours | factory |
|---|---|---|
| `Audio` — the call profiles | 118 × `0x00` | 112 × `0x01` |
| `Loopback` | 8 × `0x00` | 8 × `0x01` |
| **`Music`** | 10 × `0x1` | 10 × `0x1` — **identical** |

🔑 **A navigation prompt is not a separate case here.** It plays out of the SoC like any other
Android audio, so it travels the same `Music` profile as the music it is supposed to be heard over —
and that profile is untouched. Which also means the DSP **cannot tell the two apart**: any
difference between a prompt and the music has to come from the Android policy, from groups and
curves. There is no lever for it down here.

⚠️ ❓ **`Loopback` is the one neighbouring path that was touched** — 8 nodes. If the analogue FM or
AUX signal passes through the codec's loopback rather than going straight from the MCU to the
amplifier, this is the branch it uses. Not established either way, and worth knowing before blaming
anything else for how FM behaves against a prompt.

### AGC

📻 The AGDSP's own AGC is **on** and always was: `dl_EQ_AGC_switch` = `0x0101` at ids `0x1ac` and
`0x486` (`0x760` is off), in a file identical to 4.18. Android's *effect*-level `agc` is absent
from `audio_effects.xml` — also since 4.18, also not a regression. Adding it would stack a second,
software AGC on top of a hardware one that already works; do not, without a reason.

---

## 4. Traps that have already cost time here

🔴 **An upgrade does not clean the old module directory, and `$MODPATH` is not where the module
lives.** During `magisk --install-module`, `$MODPATH` points at `/data/adb/modules_update/<id>` —
a staging copy. The installed `/data/adb/modules/<id>` keeps everything an earlier version put
there, and files the new version simply does not ship are never removed.

📻 Verified twice on a BU unit upgrading v5.2 → v5.3: `rm -f "$MODPATH/…/qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml"`
ran, and the file was still in the live module directory afterwards. Kostyantyn named the cause
before the second test finished — *"you delete it, Magisk restores it"*.

So anything that must **not** be present has to be deleted from **both** paths in `customize.sh`:

```sh
LIVE=/data/adb/modules/BitPerfect.module/system/vendor/etc
drop_route() { rm -f "$MODPATH/system/vendor/etc/$1"; rm -f "$LIVE/$1"; }
```

This matters beyond tidiness: the HAL picks its route file from
`use.i2s` × `use.a2dp_route`, so a stale route is one the HAL is entitled to load.

⚠️ **`module.prop` lies between install and reboot.** Magisk writes the new `module.prop` into
`/data/adb/modules/` while the payload beside it is still the old one, so the module reports the new
version before it is doing anything new. **Check content, never the version string.**

✅ **Fixed 28.08.2026 — the heal block is gone, deliberately.** What follows is why, so nobody adds
it back as an improvement.

🔴 **The v5.1 heal block overwrote a legitimate user setting.** It rewrote
`persist.sys.main_volume` from `15` to `12`, on the theory that `15` can only be v5.0's mistake. It
cannot: 🔬 **that property is the start-up volume slider in CarSettings**, on a 0…32 scale, and `15`
sits squarely inside the range a person can choose. Anyone who happens to land there gets silently
pulled back to 12 on every boot.

⚠️ **Two properties, constantly confused — including in this file until now:**

| property | scale | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `persist.qf.arm.default.volume` | 0…15 | the **Android mixer**; 15 = unity. This is the module's actual intent since 4.18 and must stay |
| `persist.sys.main_volume` | 0…32 | the **start-up volume slider** in CarSettings, a user setting |

📻 v4.18 sets only the first one, three times in `service.sh` and once in `system.prop`. It never
touches the second. v5.0 wrote `15` into the second as well, on the assumption it was the same
scale — that is the whole bug, and the heal block is the over-correction. (The owner of this unit keeps it at **1**, so that an autonomous session cannot startle
the household after a reboot — which is exactly the kind of deliberate choice the block was
supposed to respect.)

A module cannot distinguish "our old mistake" from "the owner's choice" by value alone. Two options
existed — leave a marker in v5.0 and heal only on that marker, or drop the healing entirely.
**Kostyantyn chose to drop it**, on the grounds that v5.0 was pulled from distribution quickly and
reached few units, and anyone affected can move a visible slider back in two taps. Silently
rewriting a user's setting to repair our own old bug is not a trade worth making.

The property is now referenced in `service.sh` only by a comment explaining this.

⚠️ **`resetprop` does not make a `persist.` property persistent.** It writes memory only; without
`-p` nothing reaches `/data/property/`, and the value is gone at the next boot. That is why the
module re-sets its properties in a loop every boot — and why a module's damage to such a property
heals itself on reboot, along with any fix.

🔴🔴 **The audio chip test is always true, and that is why BD units rasp.**

`customize.sh` tests `${HW_CODE:4:2} == "21"` — characters 4 and 5. 🔬 Those are the **control panel
type** and the **power/op-amp bitmask** (`ProductInfoConstants.EX_DEVICE_TYPE_ARRAY`,
`POWER_OFF_METHOD_ARRAY`). Neither has anything to do with audio, and both are identical across the
fleet:

| firmware | real hardware | `${HW_CODE:4:2}` | what the module installs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `002121` | BU32107 + TDA7708 | `21` | BU I2S profile ✅ correct |
| `004121` | BU32107 + TEF6686 | `21` | BU I2S profile ✅ correct |
| `001121` | BU32107 + TSC4745 | `21` | BU I2S profile ✅ correct |
| `011021` | **BD37534**, analogue | `21` | **BU I2S profile** 🔴 **wrong** |

The test has never distinguished anything — it is true on every unit, so the BD branch is dead code
and **every** BD head unit receives the 24-bit I2S profile for a processor that has only analogue
inputs.

✅ **The correct test is `${HW_CODE:1:1}`** — the sound processor: `0` BU32107, `1` BD37534,
`2` AK7738, `3` AK7604. Or, equivalently for routing, read what the HAL already published:
`persist.sys.qf.arm.use.i2s`. Full decode table in
[13-MCU-FIRMWARE-VARIANTS.md](13-MCU-FIRMWARE-VARIANTS.md) §1.

📻 On this unit the property is already there and correct:

```
persist.sys.qf.arm.use.i2s = true
persist.sys.qf.radio.ext   = true
persist.sys.qf.mcu.version = QF05.V02.13.20251124.002121
```

Read it. Do not re-derive it. The decode table for every position is in
[13-MCU-FIRMWARE-VARIANTS.md](13-MCU-FIRMWARE-VARIANTS.md) §1.

⚠️ **A failed detection must land on the safe profile.** Since v5.1 the shipped `system/` holds the
**BD37544 16-bit** files, so any failure path is silent rather than noisy, and the installer says so
out loud. On a BU32107 the correct profile is copied over it at install.

### 🐢 The volume keeper boots a Java VM every 3.4 seconds, forever

🔬 `service.sh` 126–168: for 25 s after boot it reads `media volume --stream 3 --get` in a loop with
`sleep 0.3`, then forever with `sleep 3`. `media` is not a binary but a script that starts
`app_process` with the whole framework, so every read is a VM boot. 📻 11.09.2026, owner's unit,
logcat: `AndroidRuntime START … uid 0 … Calling main entry com.android.commands.media.Media …
Shutting down VM` every ~3.4 s, each about 0.23 s from start to shutdown — around the clock, to read
one number. The 25-second boot phase does it back to back, at the very moment the audioserver race
lives. ❓ A read that does not start a VM (a property, `settings`, a binder call) — not checked yet
whether any of them tracks the live index here; decide before changing.

## 5. Reading the factory copy of any of these files

🔑 **Easiest source first: the unpacked firmware on the desk.**

```
D:\Release\update(2)\vendor\vendor\etc\          every audio XML, all four routes
D:\Release\update(2)\system\system\system\config\NaviApp.ini
```

Untouched, no root, no mounting, no module overlay in the way. This is where to look when the
question is "what does the factory ship" — which is almost always the question. Mount the partition
on a unit only when the question is specifically "what does *this* head unit have", e.g. when
collecting a snapshot from somebody else's hardware whose firmware build may differ.

The overlay hides the original, and this build of Magisk has no mirror. The vendor partition can be
mounted a second time, read-only:

```bash
mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/vraw
mount -o ro /dev/block/dm-1 /data/local/tmp/vraw
cat /data/local/tmp/vraw/etc/audio_params/sprd/audio_pga.xml
umount /data/local/tmp/vraw && rmdir /data/local/tmp/vraw
```

⚠️ Do not `cd` into the mount point — the unmount then fails with "Device or resource busy".
`/vendor` here is an overlayfs (`lowerdir=/vendor`, `upperdir=/mnt/scratch/overlay/vendor/upper`),
and the upper layer holds no audio files: the overriding is Magisk's, not overlayfs's.

---

## 7. The HAL picks the route itself — the module must not fight it

📻 Found by grepping the vendor partition for the property: the only binary that touches it is
**`/vendor/lib/hw/audio.primary.ums512.so`**, and it does not merely read it — it *writes* it.

```
persist.sys.qf.mcu.version          ← the HAL parses it itself
set_mpu_i2s_property                ← and publishes persist.sys.qf.arm.use.i2s
parse_audio_route, mcu version2=%s, index=%d, i2s flag=%s
persist.sys.qf.use.a2dp_route       ← second flag: single or double Bluetooth
persist.sys.qf.product.name

/vendor/etc/qf_audio_route_has_i2s.xml
/vendor/etc/qf_audio_route_no_i2s.xml
/vendor/etc/qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml
/vendor/etc/qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml
```

So the route is chosen by **two** flags, and the module ships only half the matrix:

| `a2dp_route` | `use.i2s` | file the HAL loads | module ships it? |
|---|---|---|---|
| true | true | `qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml` | ✅ |
| true | false | `qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml` | ✅ (byte-identical to factory — redundant) |
| **false** | true | `qf_audio_route_has_i2s.xml` | ❌ factory copy stays |
| **false** | false | `qf_audio_route_no_i2s.xml` | ❌ factory copy stays |

🔴 **And the leftover file is worse than the missing ones.** `customize.sh` copies the chosen profile
*over* `system/`, which already holds the BU variant — and `cp -rf` never deletes. A BD unit
therefore keeps `qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml` from the BU set, carrying **`WD_24BIT`** on an
I2S bus that BD hardware does not use. 🧩 That is the most likely source of the digital rasp people
report on BD units — not "wrong profile", but a stale file the HAL is entitled to load.

✅ **Closed — this describes the mechanism and its history, not current behaviour.** Re-read
30.09.2026 by the session that owns the module, because the passage above reads as a live defect and
was passed on as one. `customize.sh` carries `drop_route()`, which removes the wrong route from
**both** `$MODPATH` and the live `/data/adb/modules/BitPerfect.module/system/vendor/etc` — the
second path matters because Magisk unpacks an upgrade into `modules_update/<id>` while the installed
directory keeps what an older version put there.

🔬 Traced through the whole file set for a BD unit: every file pre-seeded from the BU variant is
either overwritten by `profiles/bd37544_noi2s/`, overwritten by `common/`, or explicitly dropped.
Nothing survives. 📻 Confirmed on the bench — the live module directory and the shipped set match
exactly, in both directions, no residue.

🔴 **But the design is safe only by an unenforced list, and that is the real finding.** `drop_route`
names exactly two files per branch. Add a third route file, or any per-profile file that exists in
the pre-seeded `system/` and has no counterpart in the other profile, and the leftover returns —
nothing forces anyone to extend the list. The owner's ruling, 30.09.2026:

> *«модуль має при встановленні визначати архітектуру, і створювати папку що магіск своїм тимчасовим
> оверлеєм накладе на системну, але заборонено в принципі на пряму монтувати системні розділи рв і
> писати на пряму»*

⇒ Build `system/` **from empty** at install time from the detected architecture, instead of
pre-seeding one variant and patching it by name. Then there is nothing to leave behind and no list
to maintain. ⚠️ The rebuild has to cover the **live** directory too, not only the staging one, or a
file dropped between versions survives on the unit for good.

✅ The ban itself is respected today: no `mount -o rw`, no `remount`, no write into `/system` or
`/vendor`. The only system path touched is a `md5sum` read of the factory `audio_params`.

### 🪤 "Identical to factory" does not mean "redundant"

An audit of every shipped file against the factory copy shows two in the BD profile that are
byte-identical to what the system already has:

```
profiles/bd37544_noi2s/…/audio_pcm.xml                     identical to factory
profiles/bd37544_noi2s/…/primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml   identical
profiles/bd37544_noi2s/…/audio_route.xml                   identical
profiles/bd37544_noi2s/…/qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml identical
```

The obvious conclusion — "delete them, they overlay a file with itself" — is **wrong**, and acting
on it briefly broke the BD branch here. `system/` is pre-seeded with the **BU** variant, and the
chosen profile is copied *over* it. A factory-identical file in the BD profile is not a copy of
itself: it is what **restores the factory file over the BU one**. Remove it and a BD unit inherits
the BU `audio_route.xml`, complete with `WD_24BIT` on a bus it does not have.

🔑 So the rule is: judge a profile file by what it replaces in `system/`, not by whether it differs
from the factory. The only genuinely removable file is one that is identical to factory **and** has
no BU counterpart in `system/`.

### 🔑 Double BT is a *setting*, not hardware — and only one route file carries the width

The `i2s / no_i2s` axis is the board and never changes. The `double_bt / single` axis is a **user
setting**: it is switched in CarSettings and takes effect on reboot (Kostyantyn). So a unit must be
correct in **both** BT modes, and a module that ships only one of the pair is wrong for half the
time on the same head unit.

📻 But counting the actual control across all four factory routes changes what "correct" means:

| factory route | `VBC_IIS_MST_WIDTH_SET` entries |
|---|---|
| `qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml` | **10** (5 × `WD_16BIT`, 5 × `WD_24BIT`) |
| `qf_audio_route_has_i2s.xml` | **0** |
| `qf_audio_route_no_i2s.xml` | **0** |
| `qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml` | **0** |

The master I2S width is set **only** in the double-BT + I2S route. Nowhere else does the factory
touch it.

That explains an experiment that looked baffling: forcing `WD_16BIT`, restarting audioserver and
watching the factory `has_i2s` route fail to restore 24 bit. It was never going to — that file has
no such line. So:

| mode | what holds 24 bit |
|---|---|
| double BT + I2S | the **route file**, our five edits |
| single BT + I2S | the **module's watchdog**, every 3 s — there is nothing in the route to edit |
| BD, either mode | nobody, correctly: no I2S bus exists |

🧩 Therefore the module should **not** ship `qf_audio_route_has_i2s.xml`. There is nothing in it to
change, and inventing lines the factory never wrote would be a guess about routing structure. The
watchdog is the mechanism for single-BT, and it is enough — 📻 verified with `a2dp_route=false`:
width stayed `WD_24BIT` across repeated samples, watchdog alive.

⚠️ What the module *must* still do is delete the route belonging to the **other chip** (i2s ↔
noi2s), because that one is about hardware and a stale copy is loadable.

### What the BU route edits actually are

📻 Normalised for line endings, the whole change is five lines, in `<off>` blocks:

```
-  <ctl name="VBC_IIS_MST_WIDTH_SET" val="WD_16BIT" />
+  <ctl name="VBC_IIS_MST_WIDTH_SET" val="WD_24BIT" />
```

Counted across the factory files: `has_i2s` 23×16/26×24, `no_i2s` 13×16/25×24,
`double_bt_i2s` 18×16/41×24. The module fixes 5 of the 18 in the one file it ships.

⚠️ Six module files are stored with **CRLF** line endings (`audio_route.xml`, the three
`audio_policy_*`, `primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml`, `qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml`) while
the factory uses LF. ❓ No evidence it harms anything — XML parsers tolerate it — but it makes every
naive diff useless, and it hides real changes.

### Two separate things that were being confused

🔬 `format="3"` in `audio_pcm.xml` is the **DMA buffer width toward the DAC**.
🔬 `WD_24BIT` in a route is the **I2S bus width**.

On a BD board the chain is `Android → VBC → SC2730 DAC → analogue → BD37534 → amplifier`: the
BD chip has analogue inputs only, so no I2S reaches it and the bus width is meaningless there. The
buffer width still matters, and the factory already uses 24 bit on `mm_normal`.

📻 Proven on a live stream (BU unit, music playing):

```
pcm3p (FE_ST_FAST)   format: S24_LE   rate: 48000   channels: 2
                     period_size: 640   buffer_size: 2560
```

24/48 confirmed end to end. `buffer_size 2560 / 48000 = 53.3 ms` — the same figure the acoustic
latency measurement produced independently.

🧩 The safe improvement for BD is therefore **format only**: raise `fast` and `mmap_noirq` from
`format="0"` to `"3"`, leave `device=` alone, and touch no route. Still ❓ until one `hw_params`
from a real BD unit confirms that `fast` accepts S24_LE.

## 8. First report from another unit — 28.08.2026, NXP

📻 The first complete survey returned from hardware that is not on this desk. It is worth more than
a day of reasoning, and it corrected two of our beliefs.

```
MCU 004121  →  BU32107 + TEF6686(NXP) + I2S      the decoder was right
persist.sys.qf.use.a2dp_route = true             double BT (opposite to the reference unit)
AK hub regmap: all XX                            no chip, same as here
BitPerfect: module.prop v5.1, log says v5.0      installed, never rebooted
```

### The I2S width model is confirmed

```
BEFORE (silence):   >WD_16BIT  WD_24BIT      ← 16 bit
DURING (playing):    WD_16BIT >WD_24BIT      ← became 24 by itself
```

With `a2dp_route=true` the route file contains `VBC_IIS_MST_WIDTH_SET` and sets it when the path
opens — nobody has to hold it. With `a2dp_route=false` (the reference unit) that file is not the one
loaded, the width is in no route at all, and the module's watchdog is what keeps it. 🧩 Two units,
two mechanisms, both correct — and this is why a single "fix" for the width would have been wrong.

### 🔴 Ducking here is Android, not the hub

```
STREAM_MUSIC:  9  →  7 while the prompt speaks  →  9 after
STREAM_SYSTEM: 5 throughout
```

Two index steps, applied by Android. `persist.sys.navi_remix_ratio` is **73** on this unit and does
nothing at all: without an AK hub `AK7738VolumeManager.setMixAudio` never runs. So the owner has a
slider that cannot affect their hardware — which is exactly the kind of thing that produces two
people describing opposite behaviour.

### 🔴 The microphone sliders are not maxed out in general

```
reference unit:  mainmic.gain = 7   secondmic.gain = 7
this NXP unit:   mainmic.gain = 4   secondmic.gain = 1
```

"Already at 7 of 7, no headroom left" was a property of **one** unit, not of the platform. The open
question about re-centring the ALSA range is therefore withdrawn: people do have room in both
directions.

### What the old version actually does on that unit

⚠️ Everything above about volumes describes **v5.0 behaviour** — the module was installed but never
rebooted into. Two things stand out anyway:

- `persist.qf.arm.default.volume` reads **9**, while the log shows the module setting 15 on every
  boot (`Detected volume drop to 9! Restoring to 15...`). It sets it, something puts it back, and 9
  is what is live. Unity gain is **not** achieved there.
- Playback runs on `pcm0p` at `S16_LE` — the factory fast path, not device 3 at 24 bit. On a
  BU32107 unit with the module installed.

🧩 Both are consistent with a module that was flashed and never activated, which is why the
instructions now insist on the reboot in capital letters.

## 9. Open questions

- ✅ **Closed 28.08:** the CarSettings microphone sliders were suspected of being pinned at maximum
  platform-wide. They are not — a second unit reports `mainmic.gain=4`, `secondmic.gain=1`. The
  "7 of 7" was one owner's own setting. No range re-centring is needed.
- ❓ **Why the level of a prompt differs so much between FM and media** on NXP units. The measured
  facts: TEF6686 puts out ~1.0–1.2 V RMS, about +6 dB above a TDA7708 (🔬 Gemini, firmware and HAL),
  and one owner needs `navi gain` 7-8 on FM against 15 on media. Two owners on identical silicon
  report opposite ducking behaviour, which `navi_remix_ratio` explains — it runs backwards, and the
  MCU computes `ducking_step = (100 - ratio) / 10`.
- ❓ Whether the module should carry `codec.xml` at all, given the factory one stays in force.


## 9. 🔴 v5.3 hangs the boot on a UIS8581 unit — the installer tests the chip, never the platform

📻 Reported 20.09.2026: *"После установки QF_BitPerfect.module.v5.3-Universal.zip и перезагрузки устройство не
загружается. Логотип загрузки и ничего больше не происходит."* The owner recovered the unit and then ran the survey, so
we have the factory picture of it (`20260907_134329`) and the module's own installer (`QF_BitPerfect.module.v5.3-Universal.zip`).

**The unit is not of the family the profiles were built from:**

| | the fleet the module was built on | the unit that would not boot |
|---|---|---|
| `ro.board.platform` | `ums512` (UIS7862) | **`sp9863a` (UIS8581)** |
| MCU string | `QF05.V02.13.20251124.00xxxx` | `QF30.V03.12.20250315.011021` |
| processor / path | BU32107, I2S | BD37534, analogue (`use.i2s=false`) |
| `/vendor/etc/audio_pcm.xml`, `audio_route.xml`, `audio_config.xml`, `qf_*route*.xml` | present | **absent** |
| `/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd/*.xml` | present (7 files) | **the directory does not exist** |
| PCM devices under `card0` | `pcm0p`, `pcm3p`, `pcm10p`, `pcm12p`… | only `pcm0p`, `pcm1p`, `pcm4p`; media runs 44 100 S16_LE |

**What the installer does about it: nothing.** `customize.sh` decides only between two profiles, from
`${HW_CODE:1:1}` (sound processor), `${HW_CODE:3:1}` (path) and `persist.sys.qf.arm.use.i2s`. `011021` picks the safe
analogue profile — the right *chip* answer — and then copies that profile's `system/vendor/etc/`: `audio_pcm.xml`,
`audio_route.xml`, `audio_config.xml`, `primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml`, `qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml`
and seven `audio_params/sprd/*.xml`, **all taken from a ums512 vendor image**. On this unit those are not replacements,
they are new files describing another SoC's audio hardware — including the AGDSP parameter set, which vendor init loads
long before the launcher. A logo and nothing after it is exactly what that looks like.

🔑 **The guard is not another property test.** The honest test is the shape of what is about to be overwritten: if the
factory `/vendor/etc` has no `audio_pcm.xml` and no `audio_params/sprd/`, this module has nothing to say about that unit
and must refuse to install, with the reason printed. `customize.sh` already mounts the vendor partition read-only for its
snapshot, so the check costs nothing extra and runs before a single file is copied. A `ro.board.platform` whitelist is a
weaker version of the same idea and would do as a second line.

⚠️ For us this is a cross-project note, not our code: wDSP owns the sound, and this is the register of what the sound is
standing on. See also [[bitperfect-v53-pcm-busy-and-silent-tts]] in memory — v5.3's other two faults.


## 10. Silent TTS — what has been ruled out (20.09.2026)

The owner reports TTS dead on his own BU unit as well, and other owners say the same. Read on his unit today, with
v5.3 installed (its `service.sh` is byte-identical to the distributed zip, md5 `0d895ff…`):

- `dumpsys media.audio_policy` prints **`TTS output not available`** — and that is **factory**, not the module:
  no `AUDIO_OUTPUT_FLAG_TTS` mix port exists in the factory `primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml` of either platform
  (7862 and 8581 surveys), nor in either of the module's two profiles. The stream has never had a port here, so that
  line proves nothing about BitPerfect;
- the module's own `common/.../audio_policy_volumes.xml` gives `AUDIO_STREAM_TTS` **`FULL_SCALE`** on SPEAKER and
  `SILENT` on HEADSET / EARPIECE / EXT_MEDIA. On this unit the policy's only available output is
  `AUDIO_DEVICE_OUT_SPEAKER`, so the silent branches are not in play either;
- the dedicated MMAP stream was **closed** and the run log carried no `cannot open '/dev/snd/pcmC0D3p'` at the time of
  reading, so the unit was not in the stuck state of 14.09.

⇒ What is left is the state, not the configuration: the 14.09 case, where the HAL held `pcm3p` in `SETUP` and everything
routed there went nowhere ([[bitperfect-v53-pcm-busy-and-silent-tts]]). To pin it, the next capture has to be taken
**while a prompt is silent**: `cat /proc/asound/card0/pcm3p/sub0/status`, who owns it, the HAL's errors and the live
tracks — a snapshot afterwards says nothing.

### What the volume keeper costs, measured

The loop had been alive 12 h 52 min on the owner's unit. It starts a full ART runtime
(`com.android.commands.media.Media`) **about every 3 s, for ever** — five starts in the twelve seconds the logger
covered, i.e. ≈1 200 an hour, ≈29 000 a day - and during the first 25 s of boot it does the same **every 0.3 s**,
≈80 more starts in the window where the unit is already busiest. All of it to read one volume index and put it back to
15. A snapshot of system_server after those 12 h - PSS 217 MB, Java heap 67 MB, 166 threads, 330 descriptors, 3.7 GB of
5.8 GB free, no kills in the log - shows no leak by itself; a leak claim needs a slope, not a snapshot, and one is being
sampled.


## 11. 🔴 The volume keeper fights the platform's ducking — it watches a value, not a moment

🔴 **The owner's verdict, 20.09.2026:** *"платформа пробує змінити проп на старті, і після сну, і з цим треба боротися,
а під час життя, платформа може і буде змінювати це значення, наприклад для дакінгу, чи змішування, а ми цим
заважаємо."* The keeper is right to defend the level at two moments and wrong to hold it for ever.

Why it is not merely wasteful but actively wrong, from the module's own `service.sh`:

```sh
while true; do
    sleep 3
    NAVI_ACTIVE=$(getprop persist.sys.navi_state)
    if [ "$NAVI_ACTIVE" != "true" ]; then
        CURR_VOL=$(media volume --stream 3 --get ...)
        if [ "$CURR_VOL" = "9" ]; then   # <- identifies the event by its VALUE
            media volume --stream 3 --set 15
```

1. **Ducking on this platform is done by stepping that very index**, `15→14→…→9→8→7` and back
   ([09-NAVIGATION-AND-BITPERFECT.md](09-NAVIGATION-AND-BITPERFECT.md) §4-ter, measured on two units). The ramp
   **passes through 9**, which is exactly the value the keeper treats as "the platform stole my volume".
2. **The guard never fires.** `persist.sys.navi_state` is empty on every unit we have: four surveys (`004121` haiwai,
   `002121` jitu2, `004121` jitu2, `011021` 8581) and the owner's bench read live, `sys.qf.navi_state` empty as well.
   Empty ≠ `true`, so the branch is always entered.
3. The poll runs every 3 s and a prompt lasts a few seconds, so sooner or later a poll lands on the ramp and slams the
   index back to 15 **in the middle of a spoken prompt** - then the platform's own restore puts it back, and the two
   fight. The early-boot watchdog is stronger still: every 0.3 s for 25 s it restores on **any** value that is not 15.

⇒ The shape the owner asks for: **act at the two moments, not continuously.** The platform stamps the level at boot and
after a wake, so the keeper belongs on those events (`sys.boot_completed`, `com.qf.action.ACC_ON`, the wake the sleep
module already sees) with a short window each, and silent for the rest of the drive. Whatever the platform does to that
index while the unit is running - ducking, mixing, a source change - is the platform doing its job, and a keeper that
cannot tell those apart must not guess: a value is not an event.

## 12. 🔴 Прошивка UIS8581 прийшла — два дерева поруч, і здогади закриті (22.09.2026)

Власник дав `D:\Release\8581_QF005` (QF005, UIS8581A2H10, 6.6 ГБ, vendor розпаковано). Порівняння з
еталоном 7862 (`D:\Release\update(2)\vendor\vendor`) — **читанням файлів, не припущенням**.

### 12.1 Набір аудіоконфігів різний, і це не дрібниця

| файл у `/vendor/etc` | 7862 | 8581 |
|---|---|---|
| `audio_pcm.xml` | ✅ | ❌ |
| `audio_route.xml` | ✅ | ❌ |
| `audio_config.xml` | ✅ | ❌ |
| `audio_params/sprd/` (тека) | ✅ | ❌ |
| `qf_audio_route_has_i2s.xml`, `qf_audio_route_no_i2s.xml`, `qf_double_bt_audio_route_i2s.xml`, `qf_double_bt_audio_route_noi2s.xml` | ✅ | ❌ **жодного** |
| `audio_hw.xml` (один файл, стиль sc8830: модем, voip, `i2s_switch_*`, `ext_codec`) | ❌ | ✅ 163 рядки |
| `audio_para` (текст ~1 МБ, параметри AGDSP) | ❌ | ✅ |
| `codec_pga.xml` | ❌ | ✅ |
| HAL | `audio.primary.ums512.so` | `audio.primary.sp9863a.so` |

⇒ **Підтверджено остаточно, чому v5.3 вішає завантаження на 8581:** інсталятор кладе набір ums512, а
на 8581 такого набору немає взагалі — там інша генерація конфігурації HAL. І головне для задуму
модуля: **на 8581 немає жодного `qf_*` route-файлу**, тобто перемикання «має I2S / не має I2S», на
якому тримається вся 7862-гілка, там **нема чого перемикати**. Профіль під 8581 не може бути копією
7862 — він мусить правити `audio_hw.xml` (і, можливо, `audio_para`).

### 12.2 Заводський вихід у них різний — і це ламає саму тезу «завжди 24/48»

`primary_audio_policy_configuration.xml`, mixPort **primary output**:

| | формат | частота |
|---|---|---|
| **7862** | `AUDIO_FORMAT_PCM_8_24_BIT` | **48000** |
| **8581** | `AUDIO_FORMAT_PCM_16_BIT` | **44100** |

Те саме по всіх пристроях виводу (Speaker, Earpiece, Wired Headset): 48 000 проти 44 100.

⇒ На 7862 **24/48 — це вже заводський стан**, і цінність модуля там не в ньому, а в маршрутах,
мікрофоні й гейні. На 8581 завод дає **16 біт / 44.1 кГц**, і «зробити 24/48» там — справжня робота,
яку скопійований профіль не зробить, бо посилається на неіснуючі файли.

### 12.3 Чого на 8581 немає в первинній політиці

- mixPort **`fast`** — немає (на 7862 є);
- mixPort **`fm input`** і devicePort **`Fm Record Device`** — немає;
- devicePort'ів **USB** (`USB Device In/Out`, `USB Headset In/Out`) у первинній політиці немає
  (є окремий `usb_audio_policy_configuration.xml`).

### 12.4 Що з цього випливає для wDSP (а не для модуля)

1. **Частота виводу на 8581 — 44.1 кГц.** Наш аналізатор бере її з
   `PROPERTY_OUTPUT_SAMPLE_RATE` (виправлено 14.09 після тесту тоном), тож він адаптується — але
   урок «Visualizer каже 44.1, а мікшер 48» **стосується лише 7862**. На 8581 44.1 буде правдою.
2. **Борг «проба каналу вище 22 кГц»** на 8581 безпредметний: 44.1 кГц дає стелю 22.05 кГц.
   Свіп там має закінчуватися на 20 кГц і не вдавати більшого.
3. **`Fm Record Device` на 8581 немає** — задум «мікрофон як джерело для радіо» там не має
   заводського запису FM, і альтернатива лише мікрофон.
4. Усе це — **читання дерева, не вимір на залізі**: 8581-апарата в нас немає, тестери є.

### 12.5 Що модуль реально може дати власникам 8581 — і чого не може

Питання власника, 22.09.2026: «що хорошого в модулі ми можемо для них взагалі запропонувати?»
Відповідь із їхнього ж дерева, а не з наших звичок.

**Що там є, чого немає на 7862.** `audio_para` — **звичайний текст** «ключ=значення» з профілями по
джерелах: `Handset`, `Handsfree`, `Headfree`, `Headset`, `ISCHandsfree`, `ISCHeadfree`,
**`Recognition`**, **`Unprocess`**. Усередині — `agc_input_gain[0..7]`, `eq_switch`, `eq_control`,
`eq_mode_1..6`, `nrArray`, `extendArray`, `arm_volume`. Тобто **обробка звуку на 8581 налаштовується
текстовим файлом**, а не підміною маршрутів. Для Magisk це ідеальний випадок: накладаєш один файл,
нічого не ламаєш у схемі, завантаження не чіпаєш.

**1. Мікрофон — найбільше, і найдешевше за ризиком.** Профілі `Unprocess` і `Recognition` існують
окремо: це рівно ті джерела, якими міряють (`UNPROCESSED`, `VOICE_RECOGNITION`) і якими говорять у
гучний зв'язок. Правки, які мають сенс: прибрати AGC-розгін на вході (`agc_input_gain`), вимкнути
`eq_switch` і шумодав (`nrArray`) **на цих двох профілях**, не чіпаючи `Handsfree` (там придушення
потрібне для розмови). Політика вже оголошує на `primary input` **до 48 кГц**, тож нічого вигадувати
не треба — 48 кГц там заводські.

**2. «Уніті гейн» на 8581 живе саме тут, а не в маршрутах.** `arm_volume` і `eq_switch` по кожному
пристрою — це і є той тракт, у якому платформа «підфарбовує» звук. Модуль може поставити
одиничний рівень і вимкнути EQ на медіа-шляху, і це буде чесний аналог того, що BitPerfect обіцяє на
7862 — **без жодного route-файлу**, яких там немає.

**3. Чого НЕ можна пропонувати 8581.**
- Копіювати набір ums512 (`audio_pcm/route/config`, `audio_params/sprd`) — саме це вішає
  завантаження.
- Перемикати `qf_*` маршрути — їх там **немає жодного**.
- Просто переписати політику на 24/48: завод ставить `PCM_16_BIT / 44100` **по всіх** пристроях
  виводу. Поки не доведено, що кодек і HAL віддають 48 кГц, це не «покращення», а обіцянка.
- Сторож гучності — шкідливий на будь-якій платформі (розділ 11).

**4. Що чесно сказати про 44.1 кГц.** Більшість музики — 44.1. Вихід 8581 — 44.1. Тобто заводський
вибір там **уже без ресемплінгу** на головному сценарії, і примусові 48 його **додадуть**. Виграє від
48 лише те, що народжується в 48 (підказки навігатора, частина системних звуків). Отже «завжди 24/48»
на 8581 — це не поліпшення за замовчуванням, а компроміс, і подавати його треба як вибір, а не як
благо.

**5. Що треба виміряти на чужому апараті, перш ніж щось обіцяти** (у нас 8581 немає):
   - чи віддає кодек 48 кГц узагалі: `/proc/asound/*/pcm*p/sub0/hw_params` під час гри;
   - що насправді показує `tinymix` на тих PGA-контролях із `codec_pga.xml` (`ADCL/ADCR Capture
     Volume`, `VBC ADCL DG Set`) — це і є ручки мікрофона;
   - чи дійсно `Unprocess` дає плаский вхід: наш власний тест тоном і розовим шумом, як робили тут.

### 12.6 Чи їхній AGDSP сумісний із нашим і чи налаштовується так само (22.09.2026)

Питання власника: «мій модуль робить налаштування AEC, NR, підсилення, акцент на голосі — в них це
штатне; чи їхній AGDSP сумісний із нашим і чи є можливість його налаштувати як у нас?»

**Двигун той самий, упаковка різна.**

| | 7862 (ums512) | 8581 (sp9863a) |
|---|---|---|
| де лежать параметри | набір XML: `audio_structure.xml` (2 МБ), `cvs.xml` (2.5 МБ), `dsp_vbc.xml`, `codec.xml`, `audio_pga.xml`, `dsp_smartamp.xml`, `audio_process.xml` | **один текстовий файл** `audio_para` (~1 МБ) + `codec_pga.xml` + `audio_hw.xml` |
| іменовані ручки голосу | ✅ прямо: `aec_switch`, `ul_EQ_switch`, `ul_EQ_bass_alpha/beta`, `sidetone_switch`, `Audio_switch`, `SampleRate`, ~1300 полів `nr*` — по кожному пристрою й режиму (`Handset\NB1`, …) | ⚠️ таких листків у дереві **не видно** |
| що є натомість | — | `%audio\EQ_<Device>\eq_band_1..8`, `agc_in_gain`, `band_control` — **8-смуговий EQ і вхідний гейн по кожному джерелу**, зокрема `EQ_Unprocess` і `EQ_Recognition` |
| ARM-бік | у тих самих XML | `audio_arm\audio_arm\<Device>\AudioStructure\…`: `dev_path_set`, `agc_input_gain[0..7]`, `eq_switch`, `arm_volume`, `aud_proc_exp_control` |
| блоби DSP у `/vendor/firmware` | `audio_structure`, `cvs`, `dsp_vbc`, `dsp_smartamp` → симлінки в `/data/vendor/local/media/audio_params/` | лише `vbc_eq` → симлінк у `/data/vendor/local/media/vbc_eq` |

**🔑 Найцінніше з усього — як HAL читає параметри.** У рядках `audio.primary.sp9863a.so` стоїть
рівно такий порядок: **`/data/vendor/local/media/audio_para`**, і лише потім `/vendor/etc/audio_para`
(плюс `/vendor/etc/audio_hw.xml`, `/vendor/etc/codec_pga.xml`). Тобто **налаштований файл кладеться в
`/data`, і HAL бере його сам** — без накладання на `/vendor`, без правки розділу, без ризику для
завантаження. Для модуля це найдешевший і найбезпечніший шлях, який взагалі буває; саме той випадок,
де v5.3 ламала апарати, роблячи протилежне.

**Що з цього відповідає на питання прямо:**
- **Підсилення — так.** `agc_input_gain` / `agc_in_gain` / `arm_volume` по кожному джерелу.
- **Акцент на голосі — так.** 8 смуг EQ на джерело, і `EQ_Unprocess` та `EQ_Recognition` окремо від
  `EQ_Handsfree`: можна правити те, чим міряють, не чіпаючи того, чим говорять.
- **AEC і NR як іменовані перемикачі — ні, у видимих файлах їх немає.** Обробка при цьому **існує**:
  той самий HAL уміє дампити захват до і після неї (`audio_dumpinread_noprocess`,
  `audio_dumpinread_afternr`, `audio_dumpinread_aftersrc`, `audio_dumpinread_vbc`). Отже ручки або
  зашиті у двійкові структури `audio_para`, або живуть в образі DSP. **Це треба пробувати на живому
  8581**, а не вирішувати з дерева.

**Заодно готовий спосіб довести будь-що на їхньому апараті без нашого коду:** ті ж дамп-хуки HAL
дають запис захвату «до обробки / після NR / після SRC». Тестеру достатньо ввімкнути дамп і надіслати
три файли — і стане видно, що саме робить їхній штатний тракт.

**І окремо, за словами власника: канал мікрофона ми робимо самі.** Він у wDSP свій, працює **без
рута** і в модулі не потребує нічого. Тож цінність модуля для 8581 — це гейни, EQ по джерелах і
параметри в `/data`, а не мікрофонний канал.

### 12.7 А наш HAL так не робить? Робить — і навіть більше (22.09.2026, доведено на стенді)

Питання власника після 12.6. Відповідь: **так, і на нашій платформі це навіть зручніше** — бо
параметри, які реально грають, **уже лежать у `/data`**, а `/vendor/firmware` на них лише посилається.

**Дріт, стенд власника просто зараз:**
```
/data/vendor/local/media/audio_params/
  audio_structure   43 824   29.08.2026 22:37
  cvs               49 704   29.08.2026 22:37
  dsp_smartamp      29 752   29.08.2026 22:37
  dsp_vbc          112 604   29.08.2026 22:37
  audioparam_config.xml  10 579
```
А в заводському дереві `/vendor/firmware/audio_structure|cvs|dsp_vbc|dsp_smartamp` — **симлінки** саме
туди. Тобто DSP читає **скомпільовані блоби з `/data`**, а XML у `/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd/` —
це джерело, з якого вони зроблені: `audioparam_config.xml` прямо каже
`etc_path="/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd"` і перелічує кожен набір поіменно
(`Audio\Handset\NB1`, `Audio\Handsfree\WB1`, …, з `Path`, `Usecase`, `OutDevice`), для тюнера
`AudioTester ChipName="sharkl5" FmType="Digital" CodeType="2730"`.

**Що ще вміє наш HAL, а 8581 — ні.** У `audio.primary.ums512.so` є режим живого тюнінгу:
`start_audio_tunning_server`, `stop_audio_tunning_server`, `is_tunning`, `_tunning_thread` і файл-прапор
`/data/vendor/local/media/audio_param_tunning`. Тобто параметри можна правити **на ходу**, як це
робить заводський ПК-тюнер. У 8581 такого сервера в HAL немає — там натомість простіше: текстовий
`audio_para`, який читається з `/data` першим.

| | 7862 (наш) | 8581 |
|---|---|---|
| що читає DSP | блоби в `/data/vendor/local/media/audio_params/` (симлінки з `/vendor/firmware`) | `audio_para` — спершу `/data/vendor/local/media/`, потім `/vendor/etc/` |
| джерело в людському вигляді | XML у `/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd/` | той самий текстовий `audio_para` |
| живий тюнінг без ребуту | ✅ сервер тюнінгу + прапор `audio_param_tunning` | ❌ не видно |
| що НЕ береться з `/data` | маршрути: `audio_pcm.xml`, `audio_route.xml`, `qf_audio_route_*.xml` — лише `/vendor/etc` | маршрутів як файлів немає взагалі |

**Висновок, важливий для модуля.** Усе, що стосується **AEC, NR, гейнів і EQ голосу**, на **обох**
платформах налаштовується **без накладання на `/vendor`** — а саме накладання на `/vendor` і вішає
8581. Оверлей лишається потрібним тільки для **маршрутів** на 7862 (`qf_audio_route_*`), і лише там.

⬜ **Перевірити (день, без звуку, лише ребут):** чи відновлюються блоби з XML, якщо їх прибрати —
`mv` блоби вбік, ребут, подивитися, чи з'явилися нові з тими самими датами. Якщо так, то правка XML
плюс видалення блобів = чистий шлях тюнінгу без бінарного формату. Якщо ні — правити доведеться самі
блоби або йти через сервер тюнінгу.

### 12.8 Відповідь Дж на наш P0 (#751 → #753) — і що з неї ми перевірили самі (27.09.2026)

Повний звіт Дж — `C:\repos\agent-bridge\agent_bridge_bodies\msg_0753.md`, канонічний документ у його
базі — `C:\Users\kosty\.gemini\config\skills\qf-platform-architecture\references\26-AGDSP-AUDIO-PARAMS-ARCHITECTURE.md`.
Нижче — суть, і біля кожного пункту позначено, **чиє** це знання.

**Порядок читання (реверс Дж, адреси в `audio.primary.ums512.so`).**
- `parse_audio_config()` @ `0x35b08`: `access("/data/vendor/local/media/audio_config.xml")` → є —
  вантажить його; нема — `/vendor/etc/audio_config.xml`. 🔑 **Якщо файл із `/data` порожній або
  битий, HAL сам відкочується на `/vendor`** (перевірка кореня @ `0x35b5a`). Тобто зіпсований файл у
  `/data` не кладе звук — він просто ігнорується.
- `init_sprd_xml()` @ `0x30b64`: так само для `audio_params/sprd/<name>.xml` — `/data` першим.

**Компіляція блобів (реверс Дж).** Компілятор живе в самому HAL: `_init_sprd_audio_param_from_xml()`
@ `0x30640` парсить XML (`offset/bits/t/id/val`), `save_audio_param_to_bin()` @ `0x2f098` пише
24-байтний заголовок і тіло (`O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC`, 0644). Тригери: **файлів нема в `/data` →
генерує з XML при старті audioserver**; або ПК-тюнер через TCP/DIAG — оновлює в пам'яті й записує без
ребуту.
- ✅ **Перевірено нами незалежно, 27.09:** стенд після обнулення має блоби з датою **1970-01-01** —
  згенеровані на першому старті, ще до синхронізації годинника. Тобто регенерація «файлу нема → HAL
  збирає з XML» — факт, а не лише дизасемблер. Звідси ж: **прибрати блоб = змусити HAL перезібрати
  його з XML на наступному старті.**

**Формат `audio_structure` (реверс Дж).** Заголовок 24 байти: 16 байт магії `"audio_profile"`,
`uint32 num_mode = 0x3c` (60 режимів на QF; на телефонному BSP — 64), `uint32 struct_size = 0x2da`
(730). Тіло `60 × 730 = 43 800`. Зсув поля: `24 + mode_index × 730 + field_offset`.
- ✅ **Перевірено нами арифметикою:** `24 + 43 800 = 43 824` — рівно розмір `audio_structure` і на
  старому стенді (29.08), і на обнуленому (1970).

**Канал живого керування (реверс Дж).** FIFO `/data/vendor/local/media/mmi.audio.ctrl` (0666),
диспетчер `ext_contrtol_process()` @ `0x508b0`, таблиця `ext_contrl_table` @ `0x5a418`. Команди:
`AudioTester_enable=1` → TCP-сервер на **порту 9997** (протокол Unisoc DIAG, кадри `0x7E…0x7E`);
`sprd_aec_on=0|1` — **AEC на льоту**; `bt_headset_nrec=0|1`; `loglevel=0..5`; `agdsp_reboot`;
`FM_WITH_DSP=0|1`; `codec_mute=0|1`.
- ✅ Сам FIFO бачили на стенді 21.09 (`prw-rw-rw-`). ⚠️ Але тека `/data/vendor/local/media` —
  `drwxrwx--- audioserver system`: звичайний застосунок туди не пройде, тож для wDSP без рута цей
  канал **закритий**; відкритий він для `system` (наш `wdsp_proxy` має `android.uid.system` — окреме
  питання, не перевірене, і SELinux може сказати своє).

**Карта полів у 730-байтному режимі (реверс Дж)** — те, за що крутити:
| що | поле (зсув у режимі) |
|---|---|
| AEC | `aec_switch` `+0x08`, `aec_enable` `+0x60`, `pdelay` `+0x62`, `fir_taps` `+0x68`, `aec_ref_delay` `+0x86`, `aec_ul_delay` `+0x88` |
| шумодав мікрофона | `ul_nr_modu1..3_switch` `+0x9a..+0x9e`, `ul_min_psne` `+0xa0`, `ul_max_psne` `+0xa2`, `ul_ns_factor` `+0xa6`, `ul_ns_limit` `+0xaa` |
| EQ мікрофона (акцент на голосі) | `ul_EQ_switch` `+0x0a`, bass `+0x0c..+0x12`, treble `+0x14..+0x1a`, FIR `ul_fir_eq_coef00..32` `+0x1e..+0x5e` |
| цифрові гейни | `ul_dgain_volume1..15` `+0xe2..+0xfe`, `dl_dgain_volume1..15` `+0x244..+0x260`, `Loopback_gain` (сайдтон) `+0x26a` |
| аналоговий гейн мікрофона | `codec.xml`: `adcl/adcr_capture_volume` `+0x04/+0x08`, 0..7 = +0..+21 дБ; `audio_pga.xml`: `VBC ADC2 DG Set` |

**Захист від битих даних (реверс Дж).** `init_sprd_audio_param_from_xml()` звіряє
`struct_size × num_mode` із розібраним розміром і відкидає зіпсовані структури з
`[Fatal error] … failed offset:0x%x`.

**8581 (реверс Дж).** XML немає; `vb_effect_getpara()` @ `0x44edc` відкриває
`/data/vendor/local/media/audio_para` першим, інакше `/vendor/etc/audio_para`; розбір через
`libnvexchange.so` (`stringfile2nvstruct`); **режим важить 3360 байт** (`0xd20`) проти 730 у 7862.
Тюнінг — сервіс `eng_vdiag` (`libaudioparamteser.so`) через пару FIFO `audiopara_tuning` /
`audiopara_tuning_2`; `mmi.audio.ctrl` там лише для loopback і дампів.

**Що це дає нам на практиці.**
1. Налаштування AEC / NR / гейнів / EQ голосу **без оверлея `/vendor`**: правлений XML у
   `/data/vendor/local/media/audio_params/sprd/` + видалений блоб → HAL сам перезбере на старті, а
   якщо XML битий — відкотиться на заводський. Безпечніше не буває.
2. Для виміру: `sprd_aec_on=0` через FIFO вимикає AEC **без ребуту** — але лише з правами `system` або
   рутом. wDSP без рута цього не може; з рутом — може.
3. ⚠️ Усе, крім двох «✅», — **дизасемблер Дж**, на нашому дроті не перевірене.
