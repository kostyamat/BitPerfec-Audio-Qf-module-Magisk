# Navigation prompts, and what BitPerfect does to them

Everything here was measured on 22–23.08.2026 on a K706 (Android 10), most of it while the car was
being driven with a logger attached to the mixer. The complaint it explains is the oldest one on
this platform: *"with BitPerfect the navigation is too quiet and the radio too loud"*.

---

## 1. The platform keeps a whitelist, and that decides everything

🔬 `/system/config/NaviApp.ini`

```
#navi package name   |  allow adjust navi volume  |  volume mix(0-100), default value: appset
com.waze                                    true    appset
com.nng.igo.primong.igoworld                false   appset
com.autonavi.*                              true    appset
```

🔴 **A navigator that is not in this file gets nothing at all** — no ducking of the music, no
navigation volume, no mixing slider. It plays at full scale straight into the music, and its owner
reports that it "went silent".

- **Column 2** decides whether the platform's navigation volume applies to that app. iGO ships with
  it `false`, which is why turning the slider does nothing for it.
- **Column 3** is a per-app mix ratio; `appset` means use the global one.
- Wildcards are supported (`com.autonavi.*`, `cld.navi.*`).

📻 Measured: `pl.aqurat.automapa` is **absent** from the factory list. Five prompts in a row, one of
them five seconds long, and the music did not move a decibel. After the package was added, the
platform ducked for it on the first try.

### The rest of that folder

🔬 `/system/config/` also holds `VoiceApp.ini` (voice assistants), `SkipAppWhenAudioStart.ini`
(`system`, `system_server` — apps whose audio must not count as playback), `HideApps.ini`,
`NotKillAppsBeforeSleep.ini`, `RestoreAppsWhenWakeup.ini`, `HideNaviBarApps.config`. Worth reading
before assuming any of that behaviour is hard-coded.

---

## 2. Every navigator travels differently, and the "correct" one loses

📻 Measured with a one-second sampler over `dumpsys media.audio_flinger`, columns `Usg` (**hex**)
and `G db`:

| app | stream | usage | asks for focus | music while it speaks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Waze** | `SYSTEM` (1) | `SONIFICATION` (**13**) | no | −23 dB @ratio 82 · −37 dB with mixing off |
| **iGO** | `SYSTEM` (1) | `SONIFICATION` (**13**) | no | **−23 dB** |
| **AutoMapa** | `MUSIC` (3) | `NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` (**12**) | **no** | **0 dB — never moves** |

🧩 The platform recognises the Waze pattern (`SYSTEM` + `SONIFICATION`). AutoMapa does it the way
Android documents — and gets nothing, because nobody is looking for that, and it does not request
audio focus either, so Android will not duck for it on its own.

⚠️ Our own `USAGE_ASSISTANCE_NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` test tone lands in `AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC` on both
policy sets, alongside the media track. **Navigation and media share one output thread**, so
nothing below AudioFlinger can separate them — no VBC tap, no submix. See
[05-AUDIO-PATH.md](05-AUDIO-PATH.md).

🔴 **Provenance, checked on the wire 27.08.2026 — that measurement is stale, but not for the reason
first proposed.** It was suggested that `audio_policy_engine_product_strategies.xml` did not exist
before BitPerfect v5.0, so "both policy sets" could not have carried the mapping. **The file is
factory and has always been there:**

- 🔬 `/vendor/etc/audio_policy_engine_configuration.xml` carries the stock AOSP 2018 header, is
  shipped by **no** module (`ls /data/adb/modules/BitPerfect.module/system/vendor/etc/` does not
  list it), and it `xi:include`s `audio_policy_engine_product_strategies.xml`. Without that file
  the policy engine would not parse at all.
- 🔬 What v5.0 introduced is the module **overriding** it: `QF_BitPerfect.module.v4.18.zip` carries
  no `audio_policy_engine_*` file whatsoever; v5.0 carries three.

❓ **Unread, and it is the part that matters:** whether the *factory* copy already mapped
`NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` to `SYSTEM`. The overlay masks the original and this Magisk build keeps no
mirror (`/sbin/.magisk/mirror`, `/debug_ramdisk/.magisk/mirror` — both absent), so it cannot be read
from a running unit. It needs a stock firmware dump.

🧩 One hint only: in the v5.0 file that one line sits at a different indentation from every other
`<Attributes>` around it, which reads like a hand insertion rather than something the vendor wrote.

⇒ **Do not cite the measurement above as describing the current system, and do not cite the file as
describing behaviour either** — here the wire and the file have already disagreed once. Where a
`NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` tone lands today is ❓, and costs one tone to find out.

---

## 3. The prompt's level is one number: `navi_volume`

```
persist.sys.navi_volume         0..15, the prompt's own volume
persist.sys.navi_remix          duck the music at all
persist.sys.navi_remix_ratio    how deep, 0..100
persist.sys.backcar_remix_ratio the same for the reversing camera
```

📻 **`navi_volume` is the `STREAM_SYSTEM` index.** The report from a running unit shows both at
10, and `SYSTEM` as the only stream on the speaker not sitting at full scale:

```
persist.sys.navi_volume = 10
SYSTEM   -50..0 dB   index 10/15 ->  -16.7 dB
MUSIC / TTS / NOTIFICATION / ALARM / RING / VOICE_CALL   all 0.0 dB
```

And `ASSISTANCE_SONIFICATION` maps to `SYSTEM`, which is the route Waze and iGO take. So the whole
of a prompt's level is that one index.

🪤 Setting `STREAM_SYSTEM` by hand looks like it does nothing — I raised it to 15 and the next
prompt still measured −14 dB. 🧩 The platform re-applies `navi_volume` to the stream when
navigation starts (`QFAudioService.setOtherStreamVolume`), so a manual change is overwritten before
the prompt plays. **Change `persist.sys.navi_volume`, not the Android stream.**

⚠️ `navi_remix_ratio` runs **backwards** from intuition: a lower percentage means the music is
pushed further down, which makes the prompt clearer. 90 % is the *worst* setting for audibility.

### The slider is two different implementations

🔬 `com/qf/framework/volume/AK7738VolumeManager.java`

```java
int ratio = SystemProperties.getInt("persist.sys.navi_remix_ratio", 60);
if (volumeType.equals(VOLUME_TYPE_AUX) || volumeType.equals(VOLUME_TYPE_RADIO)) {
    if (!SystemProperties.getBoolean("persist.sys.navi_remix", true)) ratio = 0;
    DspJni.setMixerRatio(analogCompress, digitalCompress);
}
```

The **hardware** half runs only for `AUX` and `RADIO`. For Android media it is never called — there
the music is pushed down in software by `QFAudioService`. Two implementations under one slider,
which is why it does not behave consistently.

🔬 Reached from `McuManagerService` when the framework sends `CMD_ARM2MCU_MIX_AUDIO = 134` (`0x86`),
bit 7 of byte 0.

🔬 `android/qf/os/QFAudioService.java` keeps `mNaviInfoList` of `{sessionId, start_time,
package_name}` and drops an entry after 20 s, on the assumption that no prompt runs longer.

🧩 This whole class is `AK7738VolumeManager` — on units **without** that hub it does not apply at
all. That is the likeliest reason owners of other variants report the problem as much worse.
❓ Not verified: no access to such a unit.

## 4. What BitPerfect actually breaks — one thing

🔬 The module replaces `/vendor/etc/audio_policy_volumes.xml`:

| stream on the speaker | factory | with BitPerfect |
|---|---|---|
| `AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC` | speaker curve | **`FULL_SCALE`** |
| `AUDIO_STREAM_TTS` | **`FULL_SCALE`** | curve 1→−4 dB |
| `AUDIO_STREAM_NOTIFICATION` | 1→−29.7 dB | 1→−4 dB |

🔬 `DEFAULT_DEVICE_CATEGORY_SPEAKER_VOLUME_CURVE` = 1→−49.5, 33→−33.5, 66→−17.0, 100→0.
`FULL_SCALE_VOLUME_CURVE` = 0 dB at every index.

📻 Confirmed on the wire: at index 9/15 (60 %) the curve interpolates to **−20.0 dB**, and the
mixer dump shows `G db = -20` on the media track. With BitPerfect the same track shows `G db = 0`.

### The arithmetic

| | music | prompt | prompt relative to music |
|---|---|---|---|
| factory, index 9/15 | −20 dB | −14 dB | **+6** |
| BitPerfect | **0 dB** | −14 dB | **−14** |

🔴 **The navigation did not get quieter. The music got louder**, and the prompt stayed where it was,
because its level comes from `navi_volume` and not from any Android curve. The owner then turns the
MCU volume down by about the same 20 dB to make the music bearable, and the prompt goes down with
it.

~~🧩 **This cannot be fixed by curves while media is at unity gain.**~~ **Wrong, and corrected on
24.08.2026 - see the section that follows.** It *is* fixable by a curve, because the platform ducks
by moving the volume *index*, and a curve that reaches 0 dB at the top index gives unity gain and
working ducking at the same time.

0 dBFS is still the ceiling and the prompt still cannot be raised above the music. What was missed
is that it does not have to be: the music gets out of the way by itself, if the curve lets it.

⚠️ And "duck only while the prompt speaks" **cannot be expressed in the policy XML at all**. Volume
curves are indexed by the position of the knob, not by whether anything is speaking. Ducking is
`AudioService` reacting to `AUDIOFOCUS_GAIN_TRANSIENT_MAY_DUCK`, and it only happens if the app
asks — which none of the three measured navigators do.

---

## 4-bis. `sys.qf.sound.channel` is evidence one way only

📻 The channel reads reliably on a unit carrying the BitPerfect policies. **On a factory one it
wanders**, so it cannot be trusted to say what is playing - only to confirm the tuner.

🧩 The asymmetry is what makes it still usable. The two mistakes do not cost the same:

- a stray **2** while music really plays is harmless, because anything asking this has already
  asked the spectrum engine, and there is signal;
- a stray **4** while the tuner really plays is caught by **nothing** - the signal veto is silent
  exactly when there is no audio to hear.

⇒ Treat `2` as decisive, treat `4` as no information at all. Both `NowPlaying.isRadioSource()` and
the widget gate in `McuService` were written the other way at first and had to be corrected.

---

## 4-ter. On a unit with no hub, ducking is done by the volume INDEX - and a flat curve kills it

📻 From the event timelines of system reports, 24-25.08.2026. **Two different owners**, both
MCU `004121`, BU32107, `hub = none`, BitPerfect installed (`NoiseSuppressor.isAvailable()` = true).
The same thing on both:

```
10:56:47  NAVI_SOUND_START
          MUSIC 15->14->13->12->11->10->9->8->7      eight steps in about a second
10:56:53  NAVI_SOUND_STOP
          MUSIC 7->8->9->10->11->12->13->14->15      and back
```

The platform ducks the music **by stepping the Android stream volume index down and up again**.
`STREAM_11`, `STREAM_12`, `ACCESSIBILITY` and `NOTIFICATION` are stepped alongside it.

🔴 And from the same report: `MUSIC full scale (0 dB always) index 15/15 -> 0.0 dB`. The curve is
flat, so **not one of those steps changes anything**. The platform does the work and the sound does
not move. That is the whole failure, and it is why owners of these units report it as much worse.

🧩 Why worse than on a unit with the hub: there `QFAudioService` *also* attenuates the track itself
- measured, `G db` fell to -23 while a prompt played. Here the index is the only mechanism there
is, and the module has neutralised it. This confirms the guess left open in section 3, though not
by the route guessed: it is not the missing hardware mixer, it is the flattened curve.

📻 **A third unit, and the other half of the complaint (survey of 06.09.2026, delivered 20.09).** Same MCU `004121`,
BU32107, TEF6686, I2S, `haiwai`, BitPerfect **v5.1**, with a Waze prompt captured while the radio played:

```
BEFORE   STREAM_MUSIC 15/15   STREAM_SYSTEM 14/15   sys.current.vol.type = (unset)
DURING   STREAM_MUSIC  8/15   STREAM_SYSTEM 14/15   radio_type, sys.radio.vol = 5, main_volume = 6
         card0/pcm3p RUNNING  S24_LE 48000 MMAP_INTERLEAVED      <- the prompt's own path
         playback: com.waze + com.kostyamat.fmradio
AFTER    STREAM_MUSIC 15/15
```

- the same eight steps down and back, and with the flat curve the same nothing in dB;
- 🔴 and this is why the complaint has two halves: **the radio does not live on that index at all.** It has its own
  source volume - here `sys.radio.vol = 5` while the module pins the Android index at 15 - so the prompt comes out beside
  a quiet radio and is heard as *too loud*, and beside a software player pinned to full scale as *too quiet*. One flat
  curve produces both complaints at once.
- the module's own log in the same survey shows the platform's volume axe at work against it:
  `Sleep/Wakeup volume drop to 9 detected! Restoring to 15...` over and over - see
  [08-VOLUME-AND-SOURCES.md](08-VOLUME-AND-SOURCES.md) §6 row 1, where that reset lives.

### 🔴 v5.1 has already fixed the flat curve — three units side by side (surveys of 06.09.2026)

Three surveys taken the same day, read 20.09.2026. This is the natural experiment the section above was missing: two
BitPerfect versions and one unit with no module at all.

| unit | module | `AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC` on SPEAKER | TTS | the prompt's PCM | ducking during the prompt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `004121` haiwai, TEF6686 | **v5.1** | its own graded curve `0→−96, 20→−36, 40→−24, 60→−16, 80→−8, 100→0` | `FULL_SCALE` (as factory) | `pcm3p`, S24_LE, MMAP | 15→8, i.e. about **−19 dB** — it works again |
| `002121` jitu2, TDA7708 | **v4.17** | `FULL_SCALE` — **flat** | squashed to `1→−4 … 100→0`, and NOTIFICATION with it | `pcm3p`, S24_LE, MMAP | 15→6→8→15 and **not one dB moves** |
| `004121` jitu2, TEF6686 | none | factory `DEFAULT_DEVICE_CATEGORY_SPEAKER` | `FULL_SCALE` | `pcm0p`, **S16_LE** | — (radio was the source) |

What that settles:

1. **The "quiet prompt over a software player" complaint belongs to v4.17 and older.** Flat MUSIC plus a TTS curve
   squashed to −4 dB: the music sits at 0 dB, the platform's eight steps do nothing, and the prompt has nowhere to rise
   above it. **v5.1 restores both** — a graded MUSIC curve and TTS at full scale — so an owner reporting this is an owner
   who has not updated the module.
2. **"Too loud over the radio" is not the module's doing at all.** The tuner has its own source volume (`sys.radio.vol`
   = 5 and 8 on these two units) and the prompt is on the Android side at ~0 dB. Turn the radio down and the prompt towers
   over it - on any module version, and on the factory one.
3. The prompt travels on **BitPerfect's own 24-bit MMAP path** (`card0/pcm3p`, S24_LE) on both module units, and on the
   plain `pcm0p` S16_LE where there is no module. So the module does move navigation onto its dedicated path, as its
   description claims.
4. 🧩 The module's footprint is wider than the policy files: `/vendor/etc/audio_params/sprd/*` (pga, process, structure,
   cvs, smartamp, vbc) are **byte-identical on the two module units and different on the factory one**.

### The fix, and why it costs nothing

🔬 The factory speaker curve ends at `100,0` - **at the top index it already gives exactly 0 dB**.
And BitPerfect pins `persist.qf.arm.default.volume=15`, so the index sits at that ceiling anyway.

| | at index 15 | during a prompt (index 7) |
|---|---|---|
| `FULL_SCALE`, what the module ships | 0 dB | **0 dB** - ducking dead |
| the factory curve | **0 dB** | **about -20 dB** - ducking alive |

Putting `AUDIO_STREAM_MUSIC` on the speaker back onto a curve that reaches 0 dB at the top keeps
unity gain and restores ducking at the same time.

❓ Not tested on a car. The arithmetic comes from the curve tables and the timeline, not from an
ear, and it rests on the index really staying at 15 - which is what the module's own property is
for, but has not been watched over a whole drive.

---

## 5. Writing a Magisk module for this platform

🪤 **`system.prop` is CRLF** in the shipped module, and Magisk strips the `\r` — proved through
`aaudio.mmap_policy`, which exists only there and reads back clean. Do not "fix" it to LF without
a reason.

🪤 🔴 **`MODPATH=${0%/*}` at the top of `customize.sh` is wrong and was silently breaking things.**
Magisk sources the script, so `$0` is the *installer*, not the script; the line overwrote the
correct `$MODPATH` Magisk exports, and everything written through it landed outside the module.
Use `: "${MODPATH:=${0%/*}}"` so Magisk's value wins and the fallback only serves a manual run.

🧩 Prefer **merging at install** over shipping a copy of a vendor file. `customize.sh` runs before
the module is mounted, so it can read the live `/system/config/NaviApp.ini` and append to it.
Shipping a whole copy would freeze the vendor's list, and a later firmware's new navigators would
be hidden for as long as the module stays installed.

⚠️ Do not pin somebody's volume in `system.prop`. `navi_volume`, `navi_remix` and
`navi_remix_ratio` are sliders in the platform's own settings; a module that writes them every boot
takes the choice away.

---

## §13. The whole ducking chain, measured end to end (30.09.2026)

📻 First wire measurement of what §3 and §4 describe. Waze on a real route, a 440 Hz tone as the
music, `persist.sys.audio.debug=true` so the platform prints its own numbers.

### The curve is exact

`G db` read off the music track in `dumpsys media.audio_flinger` while stepping the index:

| index | 15 | 12 | 9 | 6 | 3 | 1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **measured** | **0** | **−8** | **−16** | **−24** | **−36** | **−78** |

Matches the shipped curve (`0,-9600 · 20,-3600 · 40,-2400 · 60,-1600 · 80,-800 · 100,0`) at every
point. ⚠️ `FULL_SCALE` is **gone** — §4 describes early versions, not the current module.

### What a prompt actually does

```
MapAudioStart,  naviconfigs.size()=62
2navi start, orignal volume=15, is_call_start=false
setOtherStreamVolume, base=15, mix=60, mapped=6
2adjustVolumeStepByStep, maxMusicVolume=15, currentVolume=15, target index=6
navi[0]: session=81, start_time=…, pkg=com.waze
   …
2navi stop, orignal volume=15
navi stop, resume music volume to 15
```

Music steps 15 → 6 (0 → **−24 dB**) and back. The prompt itself rides `navi_volume`=9 on the
`system` curve (`0,-4800 · 33,-2400 · 66,-800 · 100,0`) ≈ **−11 dB**, so it sits **+13 dB above the
ducked music** — and would sit 11 dB *below* it without ducking. The chain is healthy.

### 🔑 The base is `persist.qf.arm.default.volume`, and the pin is load-bearing

🔬 `services/com/android/server/audio/AudioService.java:527`, **in the constructor**:

```java
int defaultVolume = SystemProperties.getInt("persist.qf.arm.default.volume", 9);
AudioSystem.DEFAULT_STREAM_VOLUME[streamType2] = defaultVolume;   // loop over EVERY stream
```

- ❌ **Not** `persist.sys.main_volume` — an earlier note said so; measured 12 while the base was 15.
- 🪤 **Read once at boot.** Changing the property at runtime does nothing: set to 10, the next prompt
  still logged `orignal volume=15`. A runtime test of this value is not a test.
- 🔴 BitPerfect pins it to **15**, and that is what makes "resume" mean **return to 0 dB**. Remove the
  pin and the base falls to the fallback 9 — after the first prompt the digital path would sit at
  **−16 dB permanently**, and bit-perfect would die silently. The owner's reason, 30.09: *«я хочу щоб
  флінжер видав на вихід на ДСП весь звук до останнього кванта»*.

### 🔑 The person's own level is never touched

📻 45 samples across a prompt: `sys.media.vol` stayed at 8 throughout, while the Android index went
15 → 6 → 15. **The duck lives entirely in the digital domain**; the MCU level the person actually
turns is not involved.

⇒ Therefore "the platform restores a default instead of the person's level" is **not a defect under
this design** — under BitPerfect nobody sets the Android index by hand, so there is no other level to
restore. It only bites if something moves that index behind the person's back.

## 6. What to ask a stranger for

wDSP's system report (**Settings → Diagnostics → Collect**) carries all of the above without root:
which stream each usage lands in, every volume curve and what it comes to in dB at the current
index, the policy's accepted formats (which separates a factory unit from a modified one without
asking), the installed navigators checked against `NaviApp.ini`, and the audio hub.

## §12. The navigator whitelist is cached once per process (27.08.2026)

🔬 From `android/qf/os/QFAudioUtils.java` in `framework_jar/qfaudio`:

```java
public static final String NAVI_CONFIG = "/system/config/NaviApp.ini";
public static boolean is_audio_initiated = false;
public static List<AudioConfig> naviconfigs = new ArrayList();

// every lookup:
if (!is_audio_initiated) audio_init();      // reads the file
// ...at the end of audio_init():
is_audio_initiated = true;
```

🔴 **The file is read once and the result is kept for the life of the process.** Editing
`/system/config/NaviApp.ini` at runtime — even with root, even through the Magisk overlay — changes
**nothing** until whatever cached it is restarted. In practice that means a reboot.

Consequence for anything that wants to "learn" a new navigator while the car is running: the
whitelist is **not** the lever. It is a boot-time fallback. Live behaviour has to be implemented by
whoever is running — with root, the same levers are available directly
(`VolumeManager.findVolumeStateByType` + `setVolumeVal`, `AK7738VolumeManager.setMixAudio`).

### What else that file's owner exposes

| name | value | what it is |
|---|---|---|
| `VOLUME_MIX_APPSET` | `-1` | the "appset" in column 3 of the ini — leave the mix to the app |
| `PROPERTY_ORI_MUSIC_VOLUME` | `persist.sys.ori_music_volume` | 🔑 where the platform stores the music level **before** ducking, so it can restore it afterwards |
| `FLAG_NAVI` | `7419` | a marker the audio path tags navigation with |
| `VOICE_CONFIG` | `/system/config/VoiceApp.ini` | the same mechanism for voice apps |

`persist.sys.ori_music_volume` is worth knowing about before writing any ducking of your own: if two
things duck at once, this is the single slot both will try to restore from, and the second one to
save wins the memory of what "before" was.

### Which usages actually reach which group

🔬 Read out of the shipped `audio_policy_engine_product_strategies.xml`:

| usage | stream | volume group |
|---|---|---|
| `ASSISTANCE_NAVIGATION_GUIDANCE` | SYSTEM | system |
| `ASSISTANCE_SONIFICATION` | SYSTEM | system |
| `ASSISTANT` | MUSIC | music *(moved to system in BitPerfect v5.1)* |
| `MEDIA`, `GAME` | MUSIC | music |

🔴 A navigator that announces plain `MEDIA` is, to the policy engine, **the same thing as a music
player**. No curve and no volume group can separate them, because they arrive identical. Only a
per-package list can — which is what `NaviApp.ini` is for, and why it exists at all.

⚠️ `AUDIO_STREAM_TTS` is **not** the navigator channel here: it belongs to
`STRATEGY_TRANSMITTED_THROUGH_SPEAKER`, reached only by `AUDIO_FLAG_BEACON`. Its `FULL_SCALE` curve
on the speaker is the AOSP default for that strategy, not somebody's edit. Aiming navigation fixes
at it does nothing.


## 10. 🔴 What the platform actually sets while a prompt speaks: a ladder, and at ratio ≥ 90 it is the DEFAULT volume

Read in `QFAudioService` (decompiled framework), 20.09.2026, because the owner asked the right question: relative to
what does the platform mix?

```java
int base = AudioSystem.getDefaultStreamVolume(3);          // the DEFAULT, not what the person set
...
int mapped = getVolumeMixMappedForArm(base, ratio);        // ratio = persist.sys.navi_remix_ratio
adjustVolumeStepByStep(mapped, false);                     // prompt starts: step to `mapped`
...                                                        // prompt ends:
adjustVolumeStepByStep(base, false);                       // step back to the DEFAULT, not to the person's level
```

and the mapping itself:

```java
getVolumeMixMappedForArm(base, ratio):
    if (internal BT A2DP enabled && connected) return base * ratio / 100;
    if (ratio >= 90) return AudioSystem.getDefaultStreamVolume(3);   // ← no ducking at all
    if (ratio >= 80) return 8;
    if (ratio >= 70) return 7;
    if (ratio >= 60) return 6;
    if (ratio >= 50) return 5;   ... and so on down the ladder
```

Three things follow, and they explain complaints we have been treating as separate:

1. **The target is a fixed ladder, not a proportion of what you are listening to.** At `navi_remix_ratio = 60` the
   platform sets the media index to **6** while the prompt speaks, whatever the person had. 📻 The owner's own bench runs
   `ratio = 90`, so on it the "mix" target is simply the **default volume** — the platform ducks nothing, and if the
   person is listening below the default it *raises* the music for the duration of the prompt.
2. **The base and the restore are the DEFAULT stream volume** (`persist.sys.main_volume` on this platform), not the
   current one. So every prompt ends by putting the media index at the default: the level a person chose is overwritten

3. **The keeper's magic number is the platform's own mix target.** With `persist.sys.main_volume = 9` — the value on
   most surveyed units — a prompt sets the index to 9; BitPerfect's watcher reads 9, calls it "sleep/wakeup volume drop"
   and restores 15 within three seconds. What it cancels is the mixing itself, in the middle of the prompt. See
   [10-BITPERFECT-MODULE.md](10-BITPERFECT-MODULE.md) §11.

⇒ Practical, for anyone tuning this: **`navi_remix_ratio ≥ 90` switches navigation mixing off** by the platform's own
arithmetic. To hear prompts over music, keep it at 80 or below - and do not pin the volume index or the default.
